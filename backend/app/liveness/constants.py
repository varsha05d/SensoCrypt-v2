# Illumination is the PRIMARY continuous signal (see fusion.py's ILLUM_WEIGHT): unlike
# egomotion it needs no deliberate motion from the user at all, which matters for the
# actual threat model here -- a scam/deepfake call target (e.g. an elderly person) cannot
# be expected to keep the phone moving through a calm conversation. By explicit product
# decision, "checking" must never be a silent state -- worker.py pipelines challenges (the
# next one's CHALLENGE_LEAD_S latency-safety wait overlaps the current one's active
# flash+scoring window, not serialized after it) so consecutive flashes land roughly
# CHALLENGE_LEAD_S apart, not 2x that, for as long as the call isn't yet TRUSTED. The
# moment it reaches TRUSTED, worker.py stops scheduling challenges entirely -- checking is
# either constantly visible or completely off, never quietly running in the background.
# plan.md §12 targets these thresholds against a properly trained fusion model on a real
# genuine/attack dataset. This project has neither yet (§0's fuse() is a plain average, not
# a trained model) -- these values are instead calibrated against real observed scores from
# live phone sessions (2026-08-24 logged run: genuine motion windows scored S_A up to 0.52,
# r up to 0.70, but rarely sustained above ~0.35 for 3+ consecutive windows -- the plan's
# 0.80/0.60/0.35 targets a trained fusion model this project doesn't have yet, and were
# unreachable in practice even with good real motion). Tighten back toward those targets
# once there's real labelled genuine/attack data to fit fuse() against (see
# eval/negative_control.py for the kind of check that should gate any change).
