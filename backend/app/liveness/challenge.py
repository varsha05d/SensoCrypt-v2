"""Illumination challenge -- luma-only variant of plan.md §6.1.

The plan's own code sample assumes RGB face-ROI frames; this pipeline's telemetry frames
are grayscale-only (§0.2's bandwidth choice), so this scores correlation of BRIGHTNESS
against the emitted sequence's luma, not full RGB reflectance. That is a real reduction in
discriminating power (can't tell a red flash from a blue flash of equal brightness apart),
but it keeps the existing grayscale pipeline unchanged and still catches the core attacks
§6.1 targets: a pre-recorded stream cannot contain a stimulus chosen after it was recorded,
and a flat/non-responsive scene (screen replay, static photo) fails the correlation
outright. Sending full-color frames instead of grayscale is the natural next step to
recover the color dimension.
